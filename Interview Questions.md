Elevator Pitch

I'm a software developer with hundreds of hours in javascript and c#.  I've recently completed a coding boot camp and graduated without missing or failing an assignment.  I created 10 web projects throughout the course on a near weekly basis. I plan on finding a job that will enable me to further develop my abilities while working on real development products that are used by people.

2 Describe a time when it was especially important to make a good impression on a client.  How did you go about doing so?

(Situation) At my previous job, I had a customer come in just before Thanksgiving and request thousands of parts that they needed within three days. this was a near impossible task but this customer had the potential to double our stores sales.

3 Describe a time when your team or company was undergoing some change.  How did that impact you, and how did you adapt?

(Situation) At my previous job, the shop manager became ill and was out of work for several month leaving no one to fill in his role.  (Task) I was the next longest term employee after him so I stepped up to take over his responsibilities, handling the supervision of the team as well as day to day tasks like inventory and production scheduling.  (Action)  I worked with each of my team individually to help them grow their own responsibilities.  I assigned people to inventory and then oversaw the accuracy and input into the system.  I then managed the people on production and guided them through their problems making sure everything was done on time. (Result)  During the time my shop manager was out I helped a coworker get promoted, our inventory was successfully managed through our year end reports and our production doubled.

4 Tell me about a time where your responsibilities got a little overwhelming.  What did you do?  

(Situation) During the coding boot camp there was a period where I had a felt like my list of things to do was becoming insurmountable.  (Task) I was learning C# and MySQL, being given small full-stack assignments as practice daily.  I also had weekly assignments that were piling up.  (Action) The only thing I could do was prioritize my work and start getting it done as fast as I could.  I made a list of everything that I still had to do and ordered it by their due date.  (Result) Once I started checking things off of my list I started to feel less stressed and things became more manageable.  I was able to successfully complete my assignments and turn everything in on time.

5 Tell me a about a time where you worked under either extremely close supervision or extremely loose supervision.  How did you handle that?

(Task) I needed to find something to fill up the rest of my time that would also be productive. (Action) I had some prior experience in retail so I applied what I knew about managing a storefront to our lobby.  I created tags for products with part names and descriptions.  I also organized the parts so they were easier to manage and restock. (Result) My organization and displays impressed upper management when they visited and they soon after decided to implement what I had done throughout the other branches of the company.
