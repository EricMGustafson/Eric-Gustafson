Elevator Pitch

I'm a software developer with hundreds of hours in javascript and c#.  I've recently completed a coding boot camp and graduated without missing or failing an assignment.  I created 10 web projects throughout the course on a near weekly basis. I plan on finding a job that will enable me to further develop my abilities while working on real development products that are used by people.

Preparing to be a good candidate

I can prepare for an interview by researching a company and the interviewer(if possible).  Having a grasp on a companies mission can help guide my interview questions to align with what the company values.  I can also have an stockpile of scenarios ready to adapt into the questions I'm asked.



Whiteboard Challenges

I did not do any peer whiteboard challenges but I attended all of the available after class lessons and have done quite a bit of Edabit and leetcode.  When I did a whiteboard challenge it was quite intimidating having a bunch of people watch me solve a problem and I struggled to get going with the challenge.  Once I was solving the problem I felt more comfortable but still was slow to solve the problem.
